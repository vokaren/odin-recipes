    <h4>What is Pho?</h4>
    
    <p> Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes.</p>

    <h4>Where is Pho From?</h4>
        As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War.

        <li> Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
